        <p>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice
        of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper
        alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and guided mediation to foster your
        mind and body connection.</p>

        <p>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome to

        <p>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses that are supported
        by a chair or wall.  This calming, restorative experience is suitable for students of any

        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana.  Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with
            palms up.  Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply.  Sink into the mat and let your
             worries slip away.  When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push
            yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs.  Place your hands in a prayer position.
            Be grateful for all that you have in life.  Namaste.</p>
